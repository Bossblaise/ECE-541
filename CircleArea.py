# This is a sample Python script to calculate the area of a circle

# collect value of the radius
radius = input("Enter the radius of the circle: ")

# we assign the value of the Pi constant
Pi = 3.142

# Area of a circle = PI * Radius square
# Store result in the variable "Area"
Area = Pi * (int(radius)**2)

# display the result
print(Area)
